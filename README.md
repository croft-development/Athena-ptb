New super simple Athena setup

1 - Install Node at https://nodejs.org/

2 - Download the zip file on the repository (here).

3 - Extract the files

4 - Run your computer's setup file (in the RUN folder) E.g. If you are using windows run WINDOWS-SETUP.bat

5 - Open the file with your computer's OS as the name (This file is inside the RUN folder). E.g. If you are using windows run WINDOWS.bat)
If you get a discord-rpc error, just open the Run file again. This bug is rare now.

Help & Fixes
If you get a message saying Windows Defender blocked this file, please click on more info then click run anyway.
If you cant type commands in, make sure you ran the WINDOWS-SETUP.bat inside the extracted folder, not in the .zip file.
(If this still isn't working and you don't have a folder named node_modules then talk to us in #help or DM me)
Make sure you followed all the steps IN THE RIGHT ORDER.
We are aware that upon typing your first command you will get lag.
