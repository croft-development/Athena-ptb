**Setup**

1.) Download the INSTALLERS.zip/INSTALLERS.rar file (We recommend the .zip file)

2.) Extract the file (If downloaded the .rar file, use winRAR to extract it https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0)

3.) Download Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/

4.) Go into the INSTALLERS folder.

5.) Extract all items into the INSTALLERS folder (Again, use winRAR for .rar files - if you decide to use the .rar files)

6.) Go into the RUN folder.

7.) Run the file that your operating system is. E.g. WINDOWS.bat is for windows users.
