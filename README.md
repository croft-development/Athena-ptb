**Help & Fixes**

If you get a discord-rpc error, just open the Run file again. This bug is rare now.
If you get a message saying Windows Defender blocked this file, please click on `more info` then click `run anyway`.
If you cant type commands in, make sure you ran the for windows users `WINDOWS-SETUP.bat` inside the extracted folder, not in the .zip file.
(If this still isn't working and you don't have a folder named node_modules then talk to us in #help or DM me)
Make sure you followed all the steps *IN THE RIGHT ORDER.*
We are aware that upon typing your first command you will get lag.
